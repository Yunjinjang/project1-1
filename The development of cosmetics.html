	 <h1>The development of cosmetics</h1>
	 <h2>My team 'Skin for skinâ€™ </h2>
	 <p>The first Skin is another word for the shell, and the back skin represents the human skin.</p>
	 <p>I think the shells that we didn't use are new materials for skin care, so I used them to develop cosmetics. </p> 
	 <p>The team members consisted of students in the Department of Chemical Engineering who were interested in cosmetics.</p>

	 <h2>Purpose of Cosmetics Development</h2>
	 <ul>
	<li><strong>Eco-friendly</strong>  Shells are wastes and is landfilled or incinerated. Reusing discarded shells reduces waste production.</li>
	<li><strong>Organic</strong>  Natural substance can be safer than artificial substance. This reduces or eliminates the side effects of the products.</li>
	<li><strong>Reasonable</strong>  It uses discarded shells, so the material costs less. As a result, consumer prices will be set at a reasonable price.</li>
	</ul> 
	 <h2>Designing the Logo</h2>
	 <p>This symbolizes chestnut shell and honey.</p>

	 <h2>Product descriptions</h2>
	 <img src="cosmetic5.jpg" alt="cosmetic" width="300" height="300"> 
	 <p>We made 'shell we bam' by mixing chestnut shell and chestnut honey to create a synergy effect.</p>
	 <p>The function of chestnut shell is to inhibits the activity of elastase, which is the cause of skin aging.</p> 
	 <p>Chestnut honey has antioxidant and antimicrobial effects. As a result, our product, "Shell We BAM," makes your skin clean and elastic.</p>
	  <ul>
	<li><strong>Wrinkle-care Anti-aging Skin & Lotion / 120 ml</strong></li>
	 </ul>
	 <p>Skin & lotion reduces wrinkles, helps prevent aging, and makes skin clearer. It also has anti-bacterial action.</p>
	<ul>
	 <li><strong>Wrinkle-hide Anti-aging Cream / 50 ml</strong></li>
	</ul> 
	<p>Wrinkle-hiding elasticity cream that lightens the face as if it were wrapped tightly between wrinkles by turn on light on skin.</p>
	<h2>Future goals</h2>
	 <p>The goal is to make cosmetics brands that specialize in the use of shells by using egg shell membrane, shell of The green tea seed and rice bran.</p>
	 <p>We'll have to fix the price and market research because we've still made prototypes.</p>
